# Price-tracker
The application was to compare the prices of a product from different online shopping application and list out the prices accordingly.
We have tried to create the backend using python, using libraties like beautifulsoup4, requests etc.
We have tried to do the front end using html and css.
Since most of the applicaton like amazon and flipcart do not allow web scapping, we couldn't succeed in creating the backend succesfully.
We had created a website with dummy data and searcherbar.
